# ASDST Toolbox
ArcGIS python toolbox supporting the ASDST add-in.

The toolbox is being developed under ArcGIS 10.4. It appears to load OK in 10.1 (10.2, 10.3 unavailable) but some tool parameter inputs sometimes look a little funny... compatibility issues may not be addressed depending on where OEH is at with respect to ArcGIS versions once the code reaches production.

**"ASDST" is an ArcGIS add-in developed within the Knowledge Services Team of the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. The add-in provides advanced project preparation and custom analyses of very specific spatial data to support management and operational decisions pertaining to Aboriginal heritage sites.**
